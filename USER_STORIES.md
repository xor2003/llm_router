# Router Client User Stories

### User Story 1: Model Routing with Failover  
**Title:** Intelligent Model Routing with Failover  
As a **system administrator**,  
I want the router to automatically select an available model from a group and failover to alternatives when needed,  
So that requests are always processed without manual intervention even when models are unavailable.

### User Story 2: Model State Management  
**Title:** Real-time Model Health Monitoring  
As an **operations engineer**,  
I want to track model availability states (cooldown, failure count, last error),  
So that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues proactively.

### User Story 3: Rate Limit Handling  
**Title:** Automatic Rate Limit Recovery  
As a **backend service consumer**,  
I want the system to automatically handle provider rate limits by switching to alternative models,  
So that requests are processed without data loss while rate-limited models become available again after their cooldown period.

### User Story 4: Multi-Provider Client Support  
**Title:** Unified Interface for AI Providers  
As an **application developer**,  
I want a consistent client interface for different AI providers (Gemini/OpenAI),  
So that I can easily add new providers without changing core application logic.

### User Story 5: Dynamic Configuration Loading  
**Title:** Runtime Configuration Management  
As a **devops engineer**,  
I want configuration to load dynamically from YAML with environment variables,  
So that I can change models and credentials without redeploying.

### Technical Story: State Initialization  
**Title:** Automated Model State Initialization  
As a **system architect**,  
I want models to be automatically initialized in the state manager,  
So that new models added to configuration are immediately tracked.
