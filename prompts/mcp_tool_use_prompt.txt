TOOL USE

You have access to a set of tools. You must use these tools to answer the user's request. You can use one tool per message.

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<actual_tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</actual_tool_name>
